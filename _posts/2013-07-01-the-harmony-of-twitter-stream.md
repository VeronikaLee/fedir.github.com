We could interpret out Twitter stream as a music generator.

* Each emotional energy of a single tweet is a note
* Sequence of notes make the music
* White and black keys on the piano keyboard : technical messages are going together with abstract messages, to make the feed multidimensional
* Public messages should be emotionally neutral
* To many notes together make tha accord too complex to understand
