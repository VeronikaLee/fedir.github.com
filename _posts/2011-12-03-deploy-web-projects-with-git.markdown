The sequence of commands I use now, probably, it's possible to optimize more.

1. CreatingÂ remote repository. Adding `receive.denyCurrentBranch = ignore` into the config to avoid remote rejections. First commit.  
2. Local checkout. Work. Commit.  
3. Remote hard reset / force checkout.

It's also possible to use bare repository, but in this case we could have some limitation on remote side.

It's possible also to work on a branch and not on the trunk, in this case You will also need to make checkout on the remote side.
