Migrated blog to Github Pages. It's much better as I feel, as it's has automatically versioning support, markdown syntax support natively, and it's free :)

As sengine use Jekyll.

For templating use Liquid.

For syntax use Markdown.

Found very handy converter to migrate Wordpress posts automatically :
