Recently I've changed a hosting for one of Magento stores I've developed. Before it was installed on one of mine servers, but this server was some old.

So the idea was to put current Magento store aside, to have a performant hosting with satisfied requirements for Magento.

I've choosed between multiple possibilities, and have found, what companies, which provides Magento hosting ask lots of money, with some basic level of quality and performance. 

The solution was to make dedicated server for this Magento store.

Between different possibilities, I've discovered OVH's Kimsufi offer "mKS 2G" (CPU 1.2+ GHz, 2GB RAM, 500GB HDD) with annual fee 140â‚¬. It's not a XEON with 32 cores. But it perfectly feets the dimension of medium Magento shop.
