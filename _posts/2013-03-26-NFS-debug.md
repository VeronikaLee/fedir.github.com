# NFS performance debug

Debugging NFS mount for the best performance between Debian - Mint machines.

Mount details and statistics each time would be provided.

Problem : the transfert speed between our development server and my Linux Mint workstation is not stable, and sometimes is very slow.

    # dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/pcFedir/image.iso bs=16k count=16384
    16384+0 records in
    16384+0 records out
    268435456 bytes (268 MB) copied, 104.974 s, 2.6 MB/s

Why ?
