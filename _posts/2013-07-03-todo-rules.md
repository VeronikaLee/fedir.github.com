## Intro

TDDD (ToDo Driven Development) is a project management microframework, which aims fast resolving of task of any level of complexity.

## ToDo List paradigms

* be as much precise as possible
* do not add elements, which You couldn't / wouldn't do
* use tasks hierarchy to segment complex stuff in simple elements
* the absence of todos in the list is good, respect it
* done must be removed, only elements to do are still in list
* todo is the result of task analyze, and not the task itself

## Structure of TDDD list

During ToDo Driven Develoment (TDDD) our list of future planning consists from do-elements, "do-s", which should be done, and (optionnaly) in which sequence. Any additional information should be classed into corresponding do-elments.

## ToDo list tips

* todo list could be versionned
* todo list could be distributed between teams
